    "# Rationale\n",
    "A 'carpet plot' is a 2d representation of fMRI data (voxels x time), very similar to 'The Plot' described by Jonathan D Power ([Power 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811916303871?via%3Dihub)). \n",
    "This visual representation of fMRI data is suited for identifying wide-spread signal fluctutations \n",
    "([Aquino et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920301014)), \n",
    "which often come from non-neural sources (e.g. head motion).\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, the carpet plot can also reveal 'real' neural activity, especially when the activity is slow and synchronous, as is the case for **anesthesia-induced burst-suppression** ([Sirmpiltze et al., 2021](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.15.464515)).\n",
    "The `pcarpet` package implements the analytical pipeline used in the [Sirmpiltze et al., 2021](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.15.464515) paper to identify instances of burst-suppression in anesthetized humans, nonhuman primates, and rats.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works\n",
    "The pipeline consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First tha necessary data is imported, consisting of a preprocessed fMRI scan (4d NIFTI file) and a mask (3d NIFTI file) defining a single region-of-interest.\n",
    "2. A carpet plot is generated from within the mask. To make wide-spread fluctuations more visually prominent, the voxel time-series (carpet rows) are normalized (z-score) and re-ordered according to their correlation with the mean time-series.\n",
    "3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to the carpet matrix (using the `scikit-learn` implementation) and a given number (`ncomp`, default is 5) of first Principal Components - hereafter referred to as 'fPCs' - is extracted. The fPCs (e.g. PC1 - PC5) represent the temporal patterns of activity with the highest explained variance ratios.\n",
    "4. The fPCs are correlated with all voxel time-series within the carpet to get a distribution of Pearson's correlation coefficients (*r*) per fPC.\n",
    "5. The fPCs are also correlated with the entire fMRI scan, including areas outside the mask, to get the brain-wide spatial distribution of each fPC.\n",
    "6. A visual summary of results from steps 1-4 is plotted (example below).\n",
    "\n",
    "![report](../images/visual_report.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The above image corresponds to an instance of burst-suppression in a female long-tailed macaque (*Macaca fascicularis*) anesthetized with isoflurane. The carpet plot (using a cortical mask) shows a wide-spread, slow, quasi-periodic signal fluctuation, which is well captured by PC1. PC1 is positively correlated with most cortical voxel timeseries, resulting in a heavily asymmetric distribution of correlation coefficients (*r*), while PCs 2-4 show symmetric *r* histograms centered on zero. This property can be quantified by taking the median of carpet-wide *r* values (bottom right). According to the terminology introduced in Sirmpilatze et al. 2021, PC1 is an 'asymmetric PC`. Under the right circumstances, the presence of an asymmetric PC in a cortical carpet plot can be an fMRI signature of burst-suppression, with the brain-wide distribution of the asymmetric PC representing a map of burst-suppression (see manuscript for details)."
